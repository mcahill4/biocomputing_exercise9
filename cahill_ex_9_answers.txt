# The two graphs are very different, and don't really convey the same information.
# While each of the regions has almost the same mean number of observations,
# the scatter plot shows the significant variations in the data, as the 
# North region has very little and the East and West Regions have a lot of variation.
# The South Region is centered around two means, and is more of a bimodial distribution.
# So these graphs do tell different stories. In order to understand the data,
# one would have to look at both graphs,but even the scatter plot alone could
# be most helpful.
